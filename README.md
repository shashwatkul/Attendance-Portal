## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9+

- Node.js and npm

- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

- Postman (for API testing)

- PostgreSQL client

- Git

### 1. Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/shashwatkul/Attendance-Portal.git>
cd attendance-portal
```
    
2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
``` bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Configure the database connection:**

- Set your DATABASE_URL as an environment variable. Replace the placeholder URL with your actual PostgreSQL connection string. This connects your local application to your live Render database.
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

# On Windows (Command Prompt)
set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
```

### 2. Frontend Setup:
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. Install the Node.js packages:
``` bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will open in your browser, likely at http://localhost:3000.

### Creating the First HR User
Since public registration is disabled, you must create the first HR user via a script.

1. Make sure your backend server is not running.

2. In your activated backend terminal, run
```bash
python create_hr_user.py
```
